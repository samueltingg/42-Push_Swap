## Project Description
The main goal of the Pushswap project is to implement a sorting algorithm that can sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The challenge is to sort the numbers in the most efficient way possible, minimizing the number of operations used.

My Sorting Algorithm: 3 Way Quick Sort
